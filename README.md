This is an implementation of water simulation using SPH(smoothed particle hydrodynamics). 
Simplified Navier-Stokes theorem is used to compute acceleration at each time step and forward Eulerian integration to compute corresponding velocity and position.

The following are demo videos of the water simulation with low and high viscosity, respectively:
